## Tony - Introveted Student

Tony is a really shy student who knows how to use his phone and is on social media. Tony wants to have party 
to become more popular, but he is afriad to invite his classmates face to face. So Tony uses the bluetooth sharing app
at school to send invitations to everyone there who also has the app. The invitation includes pictures and a message
with details about the party for everyone to see. Everyone gets the invitation and thinks that Tony is so cool for using
bluetooth to invite them that they all come. Tony becomes popular and gains confidence.
