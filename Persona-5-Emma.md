##Emma - Aspiring Artist

Emma is a 21 year old living in the city. She's quite adept with technology.
She won't ever be found without her android phone or computer. Often, in her spare time, 
she is making music on her computer and recording vocals on her phone.
When she finishes making songs she often sends them to her friends and family as a 
trial run using Bridgefy. Bridgefy allows her to easily market herself by sending her 
songs to everyone she knows. It is the key to making her a star.
