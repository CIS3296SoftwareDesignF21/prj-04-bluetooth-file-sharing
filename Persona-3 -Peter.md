# Persona 3 - Peter
## Peter: Picky Music Listener

Peter is definitely not an expert with technology, but he knows his way around his phone. He chooses to buy his music
off the internet rather than pay for subscription services. He gets a new android phone and will like to transfer his 
music library stored in a folder on his current android phone. He realized that using the Bridgefly app he can select
all his old files and send them over to his new phone.
