## Peter: Seeting Up A New Phone

Peter is definitely not an expert with technology, but he knows his way around his phone. He chooses to buy his music
off the internet rather than pay for subscription services. He gets a new android phone and will like to transfer his 
music library stored in a folder on his current android phone. Peter has also used his phone as his general purpose 
storage device over the years and would like to tranfer in bulk, files of differnt types. He realized that using the 
Bluetooth File tranfer app he can select all his old files and send them over to his new phone.

Why this option is particulary of interest to Peter is that his current phone is not a newer one that supports quick 
setup processes over mobile date or WiFi, so his options are limited. Thanks to our Bluetooth File Tranfer App, there is
a solution an easy one at that. Rather than sending files by first going into the Gallery, sending over bluetooth, then 
going into his music library and then doing the same before finaly repepating with his videos or any other files he will
like to send over to his new phone, Peter can use the Apps ability to send multiple files of different types all at once
making his setup process hassle free
