##Luis - Aspiring Artist

Luis is a 21 year old living in the city. He's quite adept with technology.
He won't ever be found without her android phone or computer. Often, in his spare time, 
he is making music on her computer and recording vocals on his phone.
When he finishes making songs he often sends them to his friends and family as a 
trial run using Bridgefy. Bridgefy allows him to easily market himself by sending him 
songs to everyone he knows. It is the key to making him a star.
