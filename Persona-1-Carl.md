# Persona 1 - Carl
## Carl: an average, not so technically adept user

Carl is a simple man who lives in a remote village without access to cellular or wireless internet access. He and everyone he knows uses bridgefy religiously, 
as it's their only way to transfer files with the absence of other forms of telecommunication. Carl is a coal miner by trade, and his brother Tom is a 
construction worker. He has an Android phone but doesn't really know how to use it. He has a bare minimum understanding of technology; he knows how to take a 
picture and open an app but that's about it. Carl wants to use Bridgefy to send pictures of his kids to his brother who lives a few miles away. Fortunately, 
there are enough users between him and his brother to bridge the gap between them via multiple hops of bluetooth.
