# Persona 4 - Jennifer
## Jennifer: An old-fashioned teacher who is too busy to stay on top of technology trends
Jennifer is a 33 year old English high school teacher. She completed up through her bachelors in teaching and english while at Temple University in 2019. She knows very little about technology
outside of laptop and word processor usage. She spends most of her time rigorously working on lesson plans and for her students and raising her new born child. She doesnt have time to keep
up to date with the newest technology or communication trends. Jennifer's curiculum involve various handouts, worksheets, and quizes.She has never been one for accepting change in her line of
work. However, with COVID-19 still prevalent, she needs a paperless, reliable, and quick way to get handouts to her students in class on demand. As much as she was opposed to integrating online
solutions into her line of work, Jennifer uses her limited technology skills to share her material with her class.
